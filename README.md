# AudioSurf2_VRmod
A VR mod for AudioSurf 2

### Install :
Download the zip file available in the Releases section. Extract the zip in your game's root folder. Launch the game.

### Settings :
Move the ingame camera horizontaly with IJKL keys.<br>
Move the ingame camera verticaly with LeftShift + I or K.<br>
Increase or decrease VR view scale with LeftShift + U or J.<br>
Rotate camera with LeftShift + O or L.<br>
Increase or decrease UI scale with LeftCtrl + U or J.<br>
Move UI forward or backward with LeftCtrl + I or K.<br>
Press BackSpace to reset every settings.<br>

The camera and UI placement and scale is automatically saved in Bepinex/config/AudioSurf2VRmod.cfg (the file is automatically created when the game is launched the first time with the mod).
You'll also find the setting "Alternative VR Scaling mod" set to true or false. This allows to change the scaling method. One is better for huge scale, and the other is best for tiny scale. Pushing the scaling to far will make the UI go a bit crazy. Increase the UI scale in that case. Scaling is kind of an experimental function. Weird things can happen if pushed too far.

### Troubleshooting :
If your xbox gamepad doesn't work, deactivate SteamInput in the Steam Controller settings of the game.

### Final note :
Feel free to reuse, modify and redistribute the code of this Bepinex plugin as I won't work much more on it. Some AudioSurf 2 skins may have issues with it that could be fixed by adding specific functions and/or HarmonyX patches. Some other have shaders uncompatible with VR that could be fixed by the mod creator.
My mod is still a bit "rough" on the edges and not made with having the cleanest code possible in mind so, there's still lots of room for improvements.
